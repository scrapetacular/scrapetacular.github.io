      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to write one of these, but is it true? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the evidence
Are you DDOSing someone elses server? A poorly written web page spider may overwhelm the bandwidth of a small server, preventing other users from accessing it. In some cases a sudden increase in bandwidth will put the host over some arbitrary limit costing them money.
Good scraping etiquette dictates that you should at least respect any spidering intervals specified in the robots.</description>

      <description>Thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a bit of thought leadership and whatnot for SEO and inbound linkjuice purposes, hurry up and index my site pls Googlers.
I&amp;rsquo;ll mainly be writing about things related to data extraction and analysis, but occasionally some general programming topics.
The first thing I want to do is a comparison of the free tiers of all scraping services, such as ScrapingAnt, ScrapingBee etc. Things like response times for plain or js rendered sites, default countries (if not settable), and the headers sent by their client.</description>
